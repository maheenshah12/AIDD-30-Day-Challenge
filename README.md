1) What does AI-Driven Development mean to me?

AI-Driven Development, to me, means building software with the support of intelligent tools that guide me at every step. It feels like coding with a 24/7 mentor who helps me improve my logic, suggests better solutions, and removes the frustration of getting stuck for hours. With AI, I can focus more on creativity and problem-solving instead of repetitive tasks. It makes development faster, smoother, and more enjoyable by giving me constant support and confidence while learning and creating.


2) How do I see the future of Human–AI Collaboration in software development?

I see the future of Human–AI Collaboration becoming deeply integrated, where developers and AI work like a natural team. AI will take care of routine tasks, generate ideas, predict issues, and help shape systems — while humans focus on creativity, ethics, decision-making, and real-world impact. Instead of replacing developers, AI will expand what one person can achieve. And just like today, AI will continue to act as a 24/7 mentor, always available to assist, guide, and enhance our abilities. The future of development will feel more like co-creating with an intelligent partner than working alone.
